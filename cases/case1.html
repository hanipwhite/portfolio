          <h3>Case:</h3>
          <p>
            This was an individual project where we got a single week to deliver
            an interactive solution to the client. The brief was to create an
            experience-based interaction for the light festival Island of Light
            that is held in Smögen every year.
          </p>
          <!-- <h4>
            <span class="island-span"
              >“Perfect oppurtunity to reach out to 30 000 visitors.”
            </span>
          </h4> -->
          <video
            controls
            autoplay

          ></video>

          <div class="toggle-content-button">
            <!-- <h5>Read more</h5> -->
            <div class="read_more"><p>Read more ↓</p></div>
          </div>

          <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>
              The customer wants to increase participation and improve the
              experience of the festival Island of Light. The product should be
              adapted to a digital screen, such as a mobile or ipad, as it is
              the primary communication channel during the festival in addition
              to IRL elements.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p>
              I created an interactive visualization of climate change in the
              world with a focus on temperature increase. The user can see how
              much temperature has increased during their lifetime, using a
              color-coded map and also how it looks where they live. My idea is
              that visitors interact with a digital screen like an ipad, but the
              design can also be adapted to the mobile. The digital screen can
              be located in a room. A kind of "interactive corner" for all
              festival visitors to experience.
            </p>
            <video
              controls
              autoplay
              muted
              src="../bilder/movie_island.mp4"
            ></video>

            <h3>Process:</h3>
            <p>
              I wanted to take this opportunity to focus on the environmental
              issue when the client mentioned that it could be an approach. To
              create a more emotional effect on the visitor, I made the design
              choice to let the user fill in the year of birth and where they
              live. In this way, the user gets a more personal connection to
              climate change, by seeing the change during their lifetime and how
              much it has changed where they live.

            <h3>Tools:</h3>
