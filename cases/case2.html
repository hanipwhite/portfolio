					<p>SUPPORT GROUP NETWORK</p>

					<!-- <h1>Support Group Network –</h1> -->

					<h3>Work Group:</h3>
					<p>
						I worked with my digital designer colleague Eric Ellersten and three
						web developers from Yrgo.
					</p>
					<div class="middle2_3"></div>
					<h3>Case:</h3>
					<p>
						Support Group Network is a non-profit organization initiated by
						refugees and collaborates with local communities to improve the
						integration of refugees to strengthen and encourage their own
						initiatives. SGN needed help to be more accessible and reachable on
						their website and needed a own identity...

							<span class="adnan_quote">
								“We want to add colour to society, will never be the dark spot”
								— Adnan Abdulghani
							</span>
						</h5>

						<h3>Process:</h3>
						<p>
							Support Group Network (also called SGN) is growing thanks to
							collaborations with the local communities and the Swedes. SGN is
							less interested in money donations and more interested in
							collaborations that can help refugees to establish themselves in
							society. With this in mind, we chose to focus on how SGN can reach
							out with their model through their website and get more people to
							get involved.
						</p>

						<!-- <p>My focus was on web design, work process and structure as well as the moving material including content on
          social media. My designer colleague
          Erics focus was on creating the custom logo typeface and the figures. For 5 weeks we sat together and
          communicated a lot
          about all the design
          choices we made. In this way, everything we did became clear to both of us and why we did as we did.</p> -->

						<h3>Solution:</h3>
						<p>
							We took what we had learnt and narrowed it down to one sentence
							that have been dictating every decision we have made.
						</p>
						<h4>
							“We
							<span class="sgn">[SGN],</span>
							<span class="add">add color to society</span>
							<span class="you">and You,</span>
							<span class="swede">[the Swede],</span>
							<span class="happen">makes this happen.</span>”
						</h4>

						<!-- <p>
              As we want to create interaction we keep the language clear and
              point out that YOU can make a difference. We want everyone to make
              contact with us.
            </p> -->

						<p>
							For SGN identity, we made a custom logo typeface, together with a
							support figure, which makes it easy for SGN to make new logos for
							future projects. For everything else we have Noto Sans which isn’t
							only free but also has support for a ridiculous amount of
							languages which means no need to use a different typeface in other
							countries.
						</p>
						<div class="middle2_2"></div>

						<p>
							The webpage is basically a big menu. It contains six categories
							divided by colors and two options to maximise accessibility.
							Larger text and High contrast mode. Since our support figure
							represents the humans behind Support Group Network we have put
							them in a lot of different places, as the icon that moves and
							subtly in the background.

              The opportunity to contact SGN is the key element of the website.
              There are many ways to end up here. We give the user window the
              window the opportunity to end up here to make contact and dive
              deeper into your organization and finally become part of it.
            </p> -->
						<p>
							After a lot of researching, a lot of discussing, a lot of user
							feedback and a lot of tweaking, We believe we managed to capture
							and deliver what we planed on, something that from the core is
							built with a purpose, something that breathes colour, movement and
							happiness, something that really expresses the creativity that
							Support Group Network is all about. Something versatile and
							exciting. Something that will make a difference.
